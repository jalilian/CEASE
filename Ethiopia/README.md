# Ethiopia
Ethiopia is a country located in the Horn of Africa and has a diverse and dynamic demographic profile.

## Administrative divisions
The administrative divisions in Ethiopia have considerably changed over time, due to the creation of new woredas, the merger of woredas, and the elevation of some woredas to city administrations.
